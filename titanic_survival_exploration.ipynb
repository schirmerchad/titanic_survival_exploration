Which conditions did you use to split the survival outcomes in the data? How accurate are your predictions?\n",

    "Answer: I initially spent ample time attempting to split the female population through decision tree analysis but could not get over that 80% accuracy hump. I looked at Pclass, Parch, and age. I then played around with the male population and was able to weed out lower class males older than 15. From there, the next breakthrough came when I realized that people who had more than 2 siblings+spouse on the boat were more likely to not survive. Once I put those conditional statements into an organized decision Tree, I was able to get over 80% accuracy."
